# Team Code Reference

A Team Code Reference for competitive programming contests. A somewhat up-to-date pdf version may be found [here](http://www.timonknigge.com/competitive-programming/tcr.pdf).

## TODO

- [ ] Manacher's algorithm should build a datastructure that allows enumerating all distinct palindromes.
- [ ] Rewrite (and more extensively test) the centroid decomposition.
- [ ] Intersecting halfspaces [1](http://acm.math.spbu.ru/~kunyavskiy/notebook/)
- [ ] Move DP Optimizations from dp/ to .tex (as a description).
- [ ] Investigate `java.awt.geom` (esp. Area class) ([1](http://web.stanford.edu/~liszt90/acm/notebook.html#file10)).
- [ ] Link/Cut trees.
- [ ] Rework file structure in math/.
- [ ] Short description for edge classification in .tex.
- [ ] Rework Java header.
- [ ] Incremental convex hull set (for lines with arbitrary slopes, current code in dp/ does not do this)
