# Team Code Reference

A Team Code Reference for competitive programming contests. The original version that went to ICPC WF 2016 may be found [here](http://www.timonknigge.com/competitive-programming/tcr.pdf).
A more recent version for the 2018/2019 season is [here](http://www.timonknigge.com/competitive-programming/tcr-eth.pdf).

## Open:

- [ ] Fast MCMF (based on push/relabel) compatible with the flowgraph.
- [ ] O(n log n) Delaunay
- [ ] https://research.engineering.wustl.edu/~pless/506/l13.html
- [ ] Shorter convex hull
- [ ] Convex polygon preprocessing with closest point/tangent query in O(log n). Also Minkowski sums.
- [ ] Dominator tree
- [ ] Add `project selection' of Tardos/Kleinberg (7.11) to the flows section (non-trivial flow formulation)
- [ ] Link/Cut trees
- [ ] Geometry: reuse geometry essentials, e.g. convex hull uses `point` and essentials uses `P`.
