# Team Code Reference

A Team Code Reference for competitive programming contests. The original version that went to ICPC WF 2016 may be found [here](http://www.timonknigge.com/competitive-programming/tcr.pdf).
A more recent version for the 2018/2019 season is [here](http://www.timonknigge.com/competitive-programming/tcr-eth.pdf).

## Open:

- [X] Fast MCMF (based on push/relabel) compatible with the flowgraph.
- [ ] O(n log n) Delaunay
- [ ] https://research.engineering.wustl.edu/~pless/506/l13.html
- [X] Shorter convex hull
- [X] Convex polygon preprocessing with closest point/tangent query in O(log n). Also Minkowski sums. (TODO: shorter)
- [ ] Dominator tree
- [X] Add `project selection' of Tardos/Kleinberg (7.11) to the flows section (non-trivial flow formulation)
- [ ] Link/Cut trees
- [X] Geometry: reuse geometry essentials, e.g. convex hull uses `point` and essentials uses `P`.
- [X] Facts about the Tutte matrix and Edmonds algorithm. Also https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~mucha/pub/mucha_sankowski_focs04.pdf
- [ ] https://github.com/koosaga/DeobureoMinkyuParty/blob/master/teamnote.pdf
- [X] Add: Max divisors under some powers of 10.
- [ ] More about the Tutte matrix, and some applications like the Chinese postman problem.
- [ ] Unify Treap and Sequence.
- [X] Brief write-up on continued fractions. Also Farey sequence / Stern Brocot Tree.
- [ ] Test CHT on https://codeforces.com/contest/1083/problem/E
- [ ] Useful probability stuff, martingales, gamblers ruin etc
- [ ] Totient summatory function and other mobius stuff
- [X] FFT -> Fast Walsh Hadamard transform / xor-convolution.
- [ ] Berlekamp Massey
- [X] Floor sum
